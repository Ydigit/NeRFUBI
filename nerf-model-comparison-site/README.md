# NERF Model Comparison Site

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive comparison of three Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models. The website showcases images, videos, and interactive mesh comparisons to help users understand the differences and capabilities of each model.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```

```

## Features

- **Image Comparisons**: Visual representations of the output from each NeRF model.
- **Video Demonstrations**: Videos showcasing the performance and results of the models.
- **Interactive Meshes**: 3D interactive models that users can manipulate to explore the differences in rendering.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nerf-model-comparison-site.git
   cd nerf-model-comparison-site
   ```
